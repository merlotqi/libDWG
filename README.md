- **Read and Write DXF Files**  
  Supports reading and writing both ASCII and binary DXF files.

- **Read and Write DWG Files**  
  Supports reading and writing DWG files, compatible with multiple versions of DWG format.

- **CAD Geometry Operations**  
  Provides access to and manipulation of CAD geometric objects, including lines, circles, rectangles, and more.

- **Attribute Modification**  
  Supports modification of CAD object attributes such as layers, line types, colors, thickness, and others.

- **Layer and Line Type Control**  
  Allows control over CAD layers, line types, and other graphical style attributes.
